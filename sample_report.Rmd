## Report Styling
As little teaser I added a logo to the report via the YAML header. There are a lot of packages that allow you to use templates for all kinds of formats. If you know your way around HMTL & CSS you can create your own templates and even write a package which adds your own template to the selection of templates when you create a new R Markdown file. The possibilities are almost endless. Here are some ressources:

## Parameterized Report
If you have a look in the YAML header you will find a `params`-section. With that configuration you can use `Knit with parameters...`. This opens a dialogue where you can select one of the departments and create the report for that department. Try it yourself, click `Knit with parameters...` and then change the department and the year. For this sample report it is definitely an overkill but imagine you have a 20 page report...  
More on parameterized reports: [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide - Chapter 15](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html).

```{r conect_to_db}
mp_db_conn <- dbConnect(drv = RSQLite::SQLite(), 
                        dbname = "medical_physics_db.sqlite")
```

```{sql, connection=mp_db_conn, output.var="rep_data"}
-- RMarkdown supports SQL and many other languages
-- https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html#sql
-- Within a SQL-code chunk you can write SQL statements directly without using any function from the DBI-package
-- If you want to assign the output to a variable you have to specify it with the output.var option

--SELECT * from staffdose WHERE department = ?dep

SELECT hp10, department, STRFTIME('%Y', measurement_period_end) AS report_year 
FROM staffdose 
WHERE hp10>=0 AND status = ?status_ok AND dosimeter_type = ?dos_type AND report_year = ?year AND department = ?dep
```

\newpage

## Graph on page 2
With the LaTeX command `\newpage` in the R Markdown file you can insert page breaks for printing the HTML-file to pdf.

```{r figure}
rep_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=report_year, y=hp10)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,NA), 
                      # set lower bound to 0 and let ggplot automatically set upper bound
                     breaks = pretty(c(0, max(rep_data$hp10, na.rm = T)), n=10)) + 
                      # getting 10 breaks in the y-axis from 0 to maximum value of hp10
  labs(x = "", y = "Hp(10) [mSv]", # Axis names
       title = paste0("Monthly Hp(10) values in the ", params$department, " department"),
       subtitle = paste0("  Year: ", year),
       caption = "Hacking Medical Physics. Data and Idea: J. Andersson and G. Poludniowski") +
  # tweaking the plot style (optional) with the function "theme":
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = 3, color = "gray"))
