## Introduction
This is a sample report written for the R/RStudio-Version tutorial for Part 2 of the article series "Hacking Medical Physics" by Jonas Andersson and Gavin Poludniowski (GitRepo: [rvbCMTS/EMP-News](https://github.com/rvbCMTS/EMP-News.git)) in the newsletter of the European Federation of Organizations for Medical Physics (EFOMP)^[[European Medical Physics News](https://www.efomp.org/index.php?r=fc&id=emp-news)]. GitRepo for this R/RStudio version: [Michael Wieland - Hacking Medical Physics - R Version](https://github.com/michaelwiel/hacking_medphys_R_part2.git).

In order to make use of the report you have to execute the code of the tutorial first. This will fill the database used in this report with data, otherwise you will get empty graphs and/or error messages.

## Report Styling
The resulting html-report is styled with the RMarkdown built in theme `simplex`. As little example to show you how to customize the default theme we added a logo to the report via the YAML header. There are a lot of packages that allow you to use templates for all kinds of formats. If you know your way around HMTL & CSS you can create your own templates and even write a package which adds your own template to the selection of templates offered when you create a new R Markdown file. The possibilities are almost endless. Here are some resources:

## Parameterized Report
If you have a look in the YAML header you will find a `params`-section. With that configuration you can use `Knit with parameters...` (You will find it in the drop down menu of the `Knit` button). This opens a dialogue where you can select one of the departments and create the report for that department. Try it yourself, click `Knit with parameters...` and then change the department and the year. For this sample report it is definitely an overkill but imagine you have a 20 page report...  
More on parameterized reports: [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide - Chapter 15](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html).



```{sql, connection=mp_db_conn, output.var="rep_data"}
-- RMarkdown supports SQL and many other languages
-- https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html#sql
-- Within a SQL-code chunk you can write SQL statements directly without using any function from the DBI-package
-- If you want to assign the output to a variable you have to specify it with the output.var option

--SELECT * from staffdose WHERE department = ?dep

SELECT hp10, department, STRFTIME('%Y', measurement_period_end) AS report_year 
FROM staffdose 
WHERE hp10>=0 AND status = ?status_ok AND dosimeter_type = ?dos_type AND report_year = ?year AND department = ?dep
```

## Graph on new Page
With the LaTeX command `\newpage`^[[R Markdown Cookbook - 4.1 Insert Page Breaks](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/pagebreaks.html)] in the R Markdown file you can insert page breaks when printing the HTML-file to pdf.

```{r graph}
rep_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=report_year, y=hp10)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,NA), 
                      # set lower bound to 0 and let ggplot automatically set upper bound
                     breaks = pretty(c(0, max(rep_data$hp10, na.rm = T)), n=10)) + 
                      # getting 10 breaks in the y-axis from 0 to maximum value of hp10
  labs(x = "", y = "Hp(10) [mSv]", # Axis names
       title = paste0("Monthly Hp(10) values in the ", params$department, " department"),
       subtitle = paste0("  Year: ", year),
       caption = "Hacking Medical Physics. Data and Idea: J. Andersson and G. Poludniowski") +
  # tweaking the plot style (optional) with the function "theme":
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = 3, color = "gray"))
