## Parameterized Report
If you have a look in the YAML header you will find a `params`-section. With that configuration you can use `Knit with parameters...`. This opens a dialogue where you can select one of the departments and create the report for that department. For this sample report it is definitely an overkill but imagine you have 20 page report...

```{r conect_to_db}
mp_db_conn <- dbConnect(drv = RSQLite::SQLite(), 
                        dbname = "medical_physics_db.sqlite")
```

```{sql, connection=mp_db_conn, output.var="rep_data"}
-- RMarkdown supports SQL and many other languages
-- https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html#sql
-- Within a SQL-code chunk you can write SQL statements directly without using any function from the DBI-package
-- If you want to assign the output to a variable you have to specify it with the output.var option

--SELECT * from staffdose WHERE department = ?dep

SELECT hp10, department, STRFTIME('%Y', measurement_period_end) AS report_year 
FROM staffdose 
WHERE hp10>=0 AND status = ?status_ok AND dosimeter_type = ?dos_type AND report_year = ?year AND department = ?dep
```

## Graph on page 2
With the LaTeX command `\\newpage` you can insert page breaks for printing the HTML-file to pdf.

```{r figure}
rep_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=report_year, y=hp10)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,NA), 
                      # set lower bound to 0 and let ggplot automatically set upper bound
                     breaks = pretty(c(0, max(rep_data$hp10, na.rm = T)), n=10)) + 
                      # getting 10 breaks in the y-axis from 0 to maximum value of hp10
  labs(x = "", y = "Hp(10) [mSv]", # Axis names
       title = paste0("Monthly Hp(10) values in the ", params$department, " department"),
       subtitle = paste0("  Year: ", year),
       caption = "Hacking Medical Physics. Data and Idea: J. Andersson and G. Poludniowski") +
  # tweaking the plot style (optional) with the function "theme":
  theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = 3, color = "gray"))
