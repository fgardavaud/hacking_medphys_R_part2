ToDo:
- Screenshots for SQL-CodeChunks
- New TutorialVersion (with better filename) 
	* Eliminate Redundancies of Data Analysis
	* Extend SampleReport
	* Improve Function to read in data to DB
		# read drictly from drive into table
		# add arguments for path (source), table (destination),...
		# check if data added and then move files into 

Ideas:
- ShinyDashboard with SQL?


Test:
- PythonCode in RMarkdown? (maybe for Tutorial 1!?)
